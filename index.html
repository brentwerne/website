                    <h3 class="mb-0">Designing Remote Controlled Car</h3>
                    <p>My partner (Juliana Wandell) and I designed and built this remote controlled car for our "Embedded Systems" class. This remote controlled car is controlled remotely form the user's computer. It takes in arrow keys as inputs for movement. The microchip used is a Raspberry-Pi. This is the microchip that allows the remote controlled car to connect to Wi-Fi and receive inputs from the users computer. There are three power sources used. There is one 5V battery used to power the Raspberry-Pi. There are two 7.4V batteries that are used to power the six motors in the remote controlled car. Each 7.4V battery is connected to a motor controller. There is one motor controller for each side. One side controls three motors. The motor controller receives inputs from the Raspberry-Pi. Since the Rasberry-Pi doesn't have an output voltage high enough to create a logic 1 in the motor controller. We then used Op-Amps to amplify the voltage from the Raspberry-Pi to allow the Raspberry-Pi to send logic 1 that the motor controller can detect. The Raspberry-Pi can only output 3.3V and the motor controller needs at least 3.5V to get a logic 1. On the front and back of the remote controlled there is a distance sensor. The distance sensor detects if there is in an object in the remote controlled car's path and stops the car before it hits anything. The remote controlled car also has a gyro sensor that detects if the remote controlled car flips over. If the car flips it sends a signal to the Raspberry-Pi and turns of the motors until it is flipped back over. All coding do was in Python.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Programing a Game using Python</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">I created the python game using three python libraries. The libraries are pygame, random and sys. Pygame library was used to design the character (which is a red block) and the blocks that are falling. The blue blocks that are following take away a life if it hits the character or if there are no more lives it causes the game to end. If the user is able to dodge a blue block the user gets a point. The blocks fall randomly on the screen and as the score increases the blocks become faster. There are other blocks that can help the user, if the user collects them. The first is the pink block which allows the user to get an extra life and the user maxes out at 3 extra lives. The yellow block clears the screen of all the blue blocks. For every blue block that is cleared a point is added to the user’s score as if the user dodged the blocks. A green block slows the blue blocks down; however, the blue blocks speed always increases as the score increases. This causes the game to get harder as the game progresses. The random library is used to randomly generate where the blue blocks fall from. The sys library allows the program to receive inputs from key functions and assign each key a function. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Design ALU with FPGA circuit</h3>
                    <p>Designed ALU which was able to add, multiple, shift left, shift right and arthmetic shift. In order to test the multiplier within the ALU, I used VHDL code to create a testbench that wrote all possible circuit cobinations to a file then also read the file through another testbench that wrote all possible circuit combinations to a file then also read the file through another testbench to check every possible combination for a 8 bit by 8 bit multiplier. The software I used was vivado and I coded it using VHDL. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Programing Sensors with Microprocessor</h3>
                    <p>In this project I programmed an MSP430 using C++, to interact with various sensors. I programmed the photo sensor to turn on a LED when the photo sensor detects a 50% deduction in the room light and if the room light was within 10% of the original room light then the LED would turn off. In addition, I programmed a touch sensor to act as a on/off switch for a LED. It would toggle the LED on the falling edge or when removing your finger from the touch sensor. The last sensor that I used for this project is a temperature sensor. The temperature sensor was connected to two lights. If the temperature rose 2% from the room's original temperature then the temperature sensor sends a signal to the MSP430 that would turn off the green LED and turn on the red LED. If the temperature fell back to the original temperature of the room the temperature sensor would turn off the red LED and turn on the green LED.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Created A Social Media Website</h3>
                    <p>In this project a group of three members and I utilized PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL to create a social media website. Unfortunately the website is no longer being hosted on a server; however, the code can be seen <a href='https://github.com/CEN4010-S2020-G07/CEN4010-S2020-G07'>here.</a> In this project cookies were used in order to keep users logged in. MySQL was used to store user's profile information. MySQL was also used to store messages on the message boards. The message boards where created using PHP and Javascript. If a user forgot their password an automated email was sent using PHP.</p>
